15 PREAMBLE
16 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
17 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
18 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
19 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
20 with others.
21

22 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
23 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
24 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
25 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
26 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
27 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
28 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
29 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
